Feature: game generates random secret code
  In order to keep the codebreaker game interesting
  I want the game to generate a random secret code each time I play

  Scenario: 10,000 games
    Given 6 colors
    And 4 positions
    When I play 10,000 games
    Then each color should appear between 1500 and 1800 times in each position
    And each color should appear no more than once in each secret code
